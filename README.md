It's a simple arduino project, way easier then it might seem.

You will need:

Arduino UNO               // I used a cheaper Chinese version

MPU6050                   // This is a gyroscope, crucial for this project

9 LEDs                    // preferbly in 3 different colors (red, yellow, green)

breadboard                // It's a prototype, so yea, a breadboard

battery thing             // If you want to test it outside in real life then you need some sort of power source, otherwise not needed.

some wires & resistors
